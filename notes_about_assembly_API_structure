so the assembly API json has fields: rootAssembly, subAssemblies, parts, partStudioFeatures
parts includes even the parts coming from sub assemblies

the rootAssembly has occurrences, features and instances (plus extra BS)
an occurrence has position info and a path which is a list of ids kinad like a folder structrure with folders being subassemblies and the last being a part
